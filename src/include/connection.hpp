 * @brief
 * This class corresponds to the session layer of the network OSI model,
 * when the operating system establishes a new connection,
 * Connection constructor will create a socket, and bind socket to I/O object.
 * I/O object provided by asio::io_service,
 * it's equivalent to creating a layer of I/O Context in the operating system and application.
 * 
 * @example Connection application scenarios
 * 
 * @code 
 * asio::acceptor acc;
 * auto connection = make_shared<Connection>();
 * acc.accept(connection);
 * connection.start();
